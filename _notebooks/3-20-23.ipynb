    "### What is a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "- Java provides a reserved keyword class to define a class. The keyword must be followed by the class name. Inside the class, we declare methods and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access modifiers are keywords that can be used to control the visibility of fields, methods, and constructors in a class. The four access modifiers in Java are public, protected, default, and private."
