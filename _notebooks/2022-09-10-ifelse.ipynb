    "I begin by importing the scanner in order to allow myself to use the user input. After I am able to use the scanner properties I create a variable called number score which is set equal to the user's scpre that they input. Following this, I create an if else statement with a conditional that states if the users inputted score is greater than or equal to 90, they have receieved an A under Mr. Mortensen's grading. The else if is an alternate for if this condition is not met and makes the conditional if the users input is greater than equal to 80 but less than 90 then they have received a B. Likewise using the same logic I am able to the same for the rest of my conditions continuing down to if all the if and else if conditionals are not met then the else means that they receievd an F."

    "How i see it is that most of us in the class have the pleasure of being able to eat three meals a day. The little things we do complain about are so minuscule that in the larger scale of things they mean literally nothing. If something goes bad for you, you need to really think is it really worth getting this sad over. And even if it is put your head up and and get up. Resilience and Relentlessness are the two factors which differentiate success from people who are not. i am grateful that I am even in a school which offers APCSA. The classroom and resources provided to us are more than enough to help us ready for college level classes and real world jobs. Additionally, I am thankful for my accomplishments in soccer, such as making the top levels of ECNL, USSDA, and Varsity. Additionally we have won CIF divison 1 soccer, which was purely the product of our relentless team spirit and refusal to give up even when all  odds were against us. But the greatest thing about winning against all odds is the satisfaction. No one likes an easy win, we are supposed to struggle. Believe me the end reward is amazing, which is why no matter what the goal is, you need to persevere and put your all into it.\n",
