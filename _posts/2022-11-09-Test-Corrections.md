Question 7

￼

Why I got it wrong: I got this question wrong because I did not recognize that the method does not have any parameters. This would have resulted in a compile error. 

Correct Answer: D is the correct answer because the static method is using the dot operator and the object name is student. My name is supposed to be a parameter. 


Question 15

￼
Why Wrong: I got this choice wrong because there is a loop control variable called k which begins at 0. If the value is false then the elements would not be non decreasing. The data.length and has an array at data length -1.

Correct Answer: A is the correct choice because the variable k begins at 1. Additionally, the loop will be terminated when the k value has the value data.length. The method would return false even when elements would be non decreasing. 


Question 24: 

￼

Why Answer is wrong: The answer is incorrect because the 2D array starts at 0 and the new array begins at [1] [2]

Correct Answer: The correct answer is D  because it is an enhanced for loop which algorithmically fills column 0. When the loop stops then the newArray would have the value of newArray [0][2] is 7.

Question 32 

￼

Why wrong answer: This would be incorrect if the loop stopped when the i was n+1 and not k+1. 

Correct Answer: This would make the loop iterate k times. Since each was initialized to 1. This means that it is multiplied by 2 and then the answer is equal to 2^3. 


Question 34:

￼


Why I got it wrong: I got this question wrong because it uses the no parameter constructor to make center a new point with x and y equal to 0.


Correct Answer: B is the answer because choice 2 uses the two parameters to create  a new point with x and y. 



Question 37

￼

Why Wrong Answer: This is incorrect because the while loop iterates to less than 7. The output will be 1,3,5. 


Correct Answer: The correct answer will be D because the value will iterate to 1,3,5 and the loop will terminate and the output will be 1,3,5
